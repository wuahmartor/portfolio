## About Me
Hi, I'm Reuben! I am a registered nurse with experience in various nursing specialties. Motivated by the challenges I encountered in healthcare, I earned an MS in Data Science. My goal is to use my technical skills to address and rectify the lapses I've identified in the healthcare industry.

## Projects Undertaken:

## Weather Information Reporting System- US 
The system retrieves weather information for Cities in the US. The user may choose to look up weather report by inputting the City Name or Zip Code.

## Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Python and Streamlit. The system uses a content-based recommendation algorithm to suggest movies similar to the one selected by the user. It leverages the cosine similarity technique based on the genres, directors, and actors of the movies.

## Medical Supply Inventory Management System
The system helps to streamline the inventory of a small health clinic to ensure medical supplies are accurately accounted for and reordered on time. The system when complete will detect an notify staff of items nearing expiration dates. The system will also help staff maintain critical supplies to prevent running out.

## Cardiac Event Risk Determination in Patients with Heart Failure 

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the risk of cardiac events in patients diagnosed with heart failure. By analyzing clinical data, including age, anemia status, enzyme levels, ejection fraction, blood pressure, and other vital health metrics, the model seeks to identify key predictors of cardiac events. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool to understand the risk factors better and to aid in early intervention and personalized treatment plans for at-risk patients. The outcome of this project has the potential to improve patient care, reduce mortality rates, and optimize healthcare resources by focusing attention on individuals with a higher likelihood of adverse events.

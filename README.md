## About Me
I am a registered nurse with diverse experience across multiple nursing specialties. My journey into information technology began in 2004, during my time as a refugee in Ghana, where I developed a strong foundation in computer hardware, networking, and system administration. This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Economics in Nigeria. However, my commitment to family took precedence, and I transferred to Liberia before immigrating to the United States, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.

While completing my RN-BSN, my interest in nursing informatics was sparked, giving me a new perspective on the potential of technology to transform healthcare. I became deeply passionate about using technological solutions to enhance patient care and improve healthcare outcomes. This drive led me to pursue a Master of Science in Data Science, where I gained advanced skills to leverage data and technology for quality improvement in healthcare systems.

Throughout my career, I have consistently identified opportunities to enhance both patient care and operational efficiency using technology. My goal is to merge my nursing expertise with my data science skills to tackle inefficiencies and contribute to better health outcomes.

I am passionate about data-driven decision-making, continuous learning, and innovation. This makes me an ideal candidate for roles in nursing, healthcare data management, or clinical data analysis, where I can make meaningful contributions to improving healthcare through technology..

## Projects Undertaken:

## Weather Information Reporting System- US 
The system retrieves weather information for Cities in the US. The user may choose to look up weather report by inputting the City Name or Zip Code.

[Codes and Details](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/weatherReportSystem/weatherReportSystem.py):



## Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Python and Streamlit. The system uses a content-based recommendation algorithm to suggest movies similar to the one selected by the user. It leverages the cosine similarity technique based on the genres, directors, and actors of the movies.

## Medical Supply Inventory Management System
The system helps to streamline the inventory of a small health clinic to ensure medical supplies are accurately accounted for and reordered on time. The system when complete will detect an notify staff of items nearing expiration dates. The system will also help staff maintain critical supplies to prevent running out.

## Cardiac Event Risk Determination in Patients with Heart Failure 

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the risk of cardiac events in patients diagnosed with heart failure. By analyzing clinical data, including age, anemia status, enzyme levels, ejection fraction, blood pressure, and other vital health metrics, the model seeks to identify key predictors of cardiac events. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool to understand the risk factors better and to aid in early intervention and personalized treatment plans for at-risk patients. The outcome of this project has the potential to improve patient care, reduce mortality rates, and optimize healthcare resources by focusing attention on individuals with a higher likelihood of adverse events.

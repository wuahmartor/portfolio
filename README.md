## About Me
Hi, I'm Reuben! I am a registered nurse with extensive experience in various nursing specialties. Motivated by the challenges I encountered in healthcare, I earned an MS in Data Science. My goal is to use my technical skills to address and rectify the lapses I've identified in the healthcare industry.

## ðŸ›  Skills
Nursing skills in various settings: Acute, long-term care facilities, Home Health, Occupational, and Medical Case management. R, SQL, Machine Learning, PowerBI, Tableau, MS Office, Jupyter Notebook, Basic HTML, Streamlit, Computer network, Hardware, Windows Server Active Directory concepts (Microsoft Certified System Engineer on Windows Server 2003), and more.

## Projects Undertaken:

### Health Condition Prediction Model 
[Health Condition Predictor Model](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/diseasePredictionSystem/disease_prediction.ipynb): 
[web interface](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/diseasePredictionSystem/diseasePredictionStreamlit.py)
The machine learning model predicts a health condition based on a patient's symptoms and recommends first-aid precautions


### Movie Recommender System
[Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/movieRecommender/movieRecommender.py)
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Python and Streamlit. The system uses a content-based recommendation algorithm to suggest movies similar to the one selected by the user. It leverages the cosine similarity technique based on the genres, directors, and actors of the movies.



### Weather Information Reporting System- US 
[Weather Information Reporting System](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/weatherReportSystem/weatherReportSystem.py):
The system retrieves weather information for Cities in the US. The user may choose to look up weather report by inputting the City Name or Zip Code



### Food Quality Detection System Model At a Meatpacking Plant
[Meat Quality Checker](
https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/foodQualityDetectionSystem/foodQualityDectection.ipynb): Based on Meat indicated production factors, the model predicts the quality status of the meat as either being good or bad. 


### Cardiac Event Risk Determination in Patients with Heart Failure 
Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess the risk of cardiac events in patients diagnosed with heart failure. By analyzing clinical data, including age, anemia status, enzyme levels, ejection fraction, blood pressure, and other vital health metrics, the model seeks to identify key predictors of cardiac events. The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool to understand the risk factors better and to aid in early intervention and personalized treatment plans for at-risk patients. The outcome of this project has the potential to improve patient care, reduce mortality rates, and optimize healthcare resources by focusing attention on individuals with a higher likelihood of adverse events.

[Cardiac Event Detection Model](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/heartFailurePredictionModel/heartFailurePrediction.ipynb): Model uses certain health parameters to predict a patient's chance of developing a cardiac even given the patient has a heart failure.

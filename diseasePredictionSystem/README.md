## Weather Information Reporting System- US 
[Weather Information Reporting System](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/weatherReportSystem/weatherReportSystem.py):
The system retrieves weather information for Cities in the US. The user may choose to look up weather report by inputing City Name or Zip Code



## Food Quality Dectection System Model At a Meat packing Plant


[Meat Quality Checker](
https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/foodQualityDetectionSystem/foodQualityDectection.ipynb): Based on Meat indicated production factors, the model predicts the quality status of the meat as either being good or bad. 


## Cardiac Event Risk Determination in Patient with Heart Failure 
[Cardiac Event Dectection Model](https://github.com/wuahmartor/portfolio/blob/main/heartFailurePredictionModel/heartFailurePrediction.ipynb): Model uses certain health parameters to predict patient's chance of developing a cardiac even given the patient has a heart failure.

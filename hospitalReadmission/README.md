# Hospital Readmission Analysis

## Objective
To analyze and model hospital readmission rates to identify key factors contributing to high readmission and provide actionable insights to
healthcare facilities.

Excess hospital readmissions present a significant challenge for healthcare providers, affecting both patient outcomes and financial performance. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies hospitals at risk of high readmission rates, enabling targeted interventions to improve care quality, optimize resource allocation, and reduce costs associated with readmissions. By addressing this issue, hospitals can not only enhance patient satisfaction but also avoid penalties under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)
Background/History

Hospital readmission rates have long been a critical indicator of care quality. Under the HRRP, hospitals with higher-than-expected readmissions face financial penalties, making it essential for them to improve care coordination and discharge planning. This initiative aligns with broader efforts to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs under the Affordable Care Act. Historical data on hospital readmissions is leveraged in this project to analyze key factors influencing readmission rates and to develop actionable strategies for improvement.


Data Explanation
The dataset used in this project includes hospital-level metrics such as the number of discharges, predicted readmission rates, expected readmission rates, and excess readmission ratios (ERR). Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, focusing on relevant features, and grouping data by state and facility for performance evaluation. Key variables include ERR, which represents observed-to-expected readmissions, and predictors such as discharge numbers and readmission rates. These data elements were used to build a robust model aimed at identifying high-risk hospitals and addressing readmission challenges.

Methods
This project employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in the dataset, followed by regression modeling to predict ERR. A linear regression model was chosen for its interpretability and simplicity. Evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²), were used to assess the model’s performance. The analysis highlighted the key predictors of high ERRs and provided a foundation for targeted improvements.

Analysis
The analysis confirms the model’s strong performance in predicting Excess Readmission Ratios (ERR), with 1,552 out of 1,578 predictions (98.3%) falling within a ±10% threshold. This high accuracy underscores the model’s reliability for evaluating hospital performance and guiding targeted interventions to reduce readmissions. The minimal number of inaccurate predictions (26) indicates a well-calibrated model with low deviation from actual values. However, the complete absence of false positives or false negatives raises concerns about potential overfitting, which could affect the model’s ability to generalize to new data. Validation on an unseen dataset is essential to confirm its robustness.
The hospital-level analysis reveals significant variations in discharge volumes. Most hospitals have a low number of discharges, while a smaller number of high-capacity facilities handle significantly higher volumes. This skewed distribution suggests that resource allocation and intervention strategies should be tailored to hospital size, as the needs of low-volume hospitals differ from those of high-capacity ones.
State-level analysis adds further granularity, identifying Massachusetts as having the highest ERR (1.042) and Idaho the lowest (0.942). This indicates disparities in readmission rates across states, which could reflect differences in healthcare practices, patient demographics, or resource availability. Such insights are critical for policymakers and hospital administrators to design targeted improvement plans that address the underlying causes of high ERR in specific regions.

To enhance the model’s utility, analyzing the characteristics of the 26 inaccurate predictions could provide valuable insights. Patterns such as outliers, unusual patient demographics, or specific hospital practices might contribute to these errors. Exploring alternative modeling techniques, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, could also help compare performance and ensure the best approach for predicting ERR. Together, these steps will refine the model’s predictive capabilities and support data-driven strategies to improve hospital readmission outcomes.
Conclusion
The predictive model successfully identifies hospitals with high ERRs, offering valuable insights for improving care quality and reducing readmissions. By focusing on key factors such as discharge numbers and predicted readmission rates, hospitals can implement targeted interventions to address deficiencies and enhance patient outcomes. The model’s accuracy and ease of use make it a practical tool for healthcare providers.

## Summary
Hospital readmission is a critical issue impacting both patient care and healthcare costs. This project explores a dataset on hospital readmissions, 
with features like the number of discharges, predicted and expected readmission rates, and excess readmission ratio.


### Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Prepared the data by handling missing values, filtering outliers, and selecting important features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and trends affecting readmission.
3. **Modeling**: Used a regression model to predict readmission likelihood, with a focus on minimizing error and maximizing interpretability.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like MAE and RMSE (for regression).
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Summarized key findings, highlighting factors that significantly impact readmission rates, and 
                                                                               suggested potential interventions.

## Key Findings
Certain factors, such as the number of discharges and predicted readmission rate, are strongly correlated with actual readmission.
High excess readmission ratios may indicate areas where patient follow-up or discharge planning improvements could reduce readmissions.

## How to Use This Project
1. **Requirements**: Ensure that you have Python installed, along with required packages (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).
2. **Running the Notebook**: Open `hospitalReadmission.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute cells step-by-step.
3. **Modifying the Analysis**: Adjust feature selection, model parameters, or add new metrics to tailor the analysis further.

## Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding hospital readmission, offering insights that healthcare providers can leverage
to enhance patient care and reduce costs associated with readmission.
